  summary: It's accepted by COLING 2025(CCF-B) long paper. I proposed the idea, led the experiment, wrote the paper, and finally responded with a rebuttal. In this process, I fully experienced the entire process of producing the paper. This process of realizing my ideas excites me. I believe that in the future at ShanghaiTech, whose atmosphere is particularly strong in scientific research, I can capture more interesting ideas and implement them. And notebally, I want to continuously dig out creativities whether it is in NLP or not.
